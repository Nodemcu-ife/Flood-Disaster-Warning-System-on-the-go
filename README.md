# Flood-Disaster-Warning-System-on-the-go
This project consists of two parts; the measurements of water inflow rate and water level from the flood monitoring system and using part of the data to train a Machine Learning Algorithm in Azure Machine Learning. The programming code in Arduino Integrated Development Environment is uploaded here as well as the Machine Learning package used.

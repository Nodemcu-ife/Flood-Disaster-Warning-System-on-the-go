# Flood-Disaster-Warning-System-on-the-go
This project consists of two parts; the measurements of water inflow rate and water level from the flood monitoring system and using part of the data to train a Machine Learning Algorithm in Azure Machine Learning. The programming code in Arduino Integrated Development Environment is uploaded here as well as the Machine Learning package used.
Moreover, the Flood Prediction.csv pythin script is added to this project repository as well. This code can be used to import the datasets of the flod monitoring system.
The code of the Azure Machine Learning Python Script derived from the Generate Data Access Code of the convert to CSV node in the Azure ML workspace. This code includes the workspace access token, which provides full access to the workspace.
